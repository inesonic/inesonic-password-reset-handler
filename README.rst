inesonic-password-reset-handler
===============================
This is a small WordPress plugin that provides a more full featured flow for
changing and resetting user password.  The plugin features:

* Integration with NinjaForms.  You can write password reset forms using the
  NinjaForms form editor.

* Low effort ability to recover both WordPress usernames and passwords.

* Password reset emails with timeout.

* Notification that a user's password has been reset.

At this time, the plugin is closely tied to the structure of the
`Inesonic, LLC website <https://inesonic.com>`.  For this reason, I have not
bothered to write detailed documentation.

You are welcome to download and review or fork this plugin for your own
purposes provided you comply with the terms of the license.
